1. Process customer record

A program is required to read a customer's name, a purchase amount and a tax code. 

The tax code has been validated and will be one of the following:
    0  tax exempt (0%)
    1  state sales tax only (3%)
    2  federal and state sales tax (5%)
    3  special sales tax (7%)

The program must then compute the sales tax and the total amount due,and print the customer's name, purchase amount, sales tax and total amount due.

Answer:

Print "Customer Name: "
Input CUSTOMER_NAME
Trim CUSTOMER_NAME to 50 in length

Print "Purchase Amount: "
Input PURCHASE_AMOUNT

If NOT (PURCHASE_AMOUNT is valid_currency)
	Throw CurrencyCastingError
End If

Print "[ 0=Tax Exempt, 1=State Only(3%), 2=Fed&State(5%), 3=Special (7%) ]"
Feed to newline
Print "Tax code (0, 1, 2, 3): "
Input TAX_CODE

Initialize TAX to 0

Case TAX_CODE
	0 : Break
	1 : Set TAX to PURCHASE_AMOUNT multiply by 0.03
	2 : Set TAX to PURCHASE_AMOUNT multiply by 0.05
	3 : Set TAX to PURCHASE_AMOUNT multiply by 0.07
	DEFAULT: 
		Print "Incorrect Tax code, please try again"
		Throw InvalidTaxCodeError
EndCase

Set TOTAL to PURCHASE_AMOUNT multiply by TAX
Add PURCHASE_AMOUNT to TOTAL

Print "Customer's Name : "
Print CUSTOMER_NAME
Feed to newline

Print "Purchase Amount : "
Print PURCHASE_AMOUNT
Feed to newline

Print "Sale Tax : "
Print TAX
Feed to newline

Print "Total Amount Due : "
Print TOTAL
Feed to newline



2. Calculate employee's pay
A program is required by a company to read an employee's number, pay rate and the number of hours worked in a week. The program is then to validate the pay rate field and the hours worked field and, if valid, compute the employee's weekly pay and then print it and the input data.

Validation: According to the company's rules, the maximum hours an employee can work per week is 60 hours, and the maximum hourly rate is $25.00 per hour. If the hours worked field or the hourly rate field is out of range, the input data and an appropriate message are to be printed and the employee's weekly pay is not to be calculated.

Weekly pay calculation: Weekly pay is calculated as hours worked times pay rate. If more than 35 hours are worked, payment for the overtime hours worked is calculated at time-and-a-half.



Answer:

Print "Employee's Number : "
Input EMPLOYEE_NUMBER

if NOT (EMPLOYEE_NUMBER is number)
	Print "Not a number"
	Throw NumberCastingError
End if

If NOT (EMPLOYEE_NUMBER is existed)
	Print "Employee not existed"
	Throw InvalidEmployeeNumberError
End if

Print "Pay Rate (0-25) : "
Input PAY_RATE

if NOT (PAY_RATE is number)
	Print "Not a number"
	Throw NumberCastingError
End if

if (PAY_RATE is less than 0) or (PAY_RATE is more than 25)
	Print PAY_RATE
	Print " out of range ($0.00 - $25.00)"
	Throw PayRateOutOfRangeError
End if

Print "Number of Hours Worked : "
Input HOURS

if NOT (HOURS is number)
	Print "Not a number"
	Throw NumberCastingError
End if

if (HOURS is less than 0) or (HOURS is more than 60)
	Print HOURS
	Print " out of range (0.00 - 60.00)"
	Throw HoursOutOfRangeError
End if

Initialize PAY to 0

If (HOURS greater than 35)
	Subtract HOURS by 35
	Multiply HOURS by 1.5
	Add HOURS by 35
End if
	

Set PAY_AMOUNT to HOURS multiply by PAY_RATE

Print "The Pay Amount is : "
Print PAY_AMOUNT
