2. How much water runs off the roof

How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. (So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water. Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).


Answer:

Print "Enter roof width (ft) : "
Input WIDTH
Print "Enter roof height (ft) : "
Input HEIGHT
Print "Enter number of rainfall (inches) : "
Input RAINFALL
Multiply WIDTH by 12
Multiply HEIGHT by 12
Set AREA to WIDTH multiply by HEIGHT
Set VOLUMN to AREA multiply by RAINFALL
Set RUNOFF to VOLUMN divide by 231
Print "Water runs off is "
Print RUNOFF
Print " gallons"
